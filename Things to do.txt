Gibbs sampling
- Manage different input formats (npy, .params)
- Compare PyTorch vs. NumPy implementations

PLMC-EM
- Test on synthetic data with same hi and different Jij
- Figure out the error with plmc on large alignments

Pyro
- Models:
	- Frequentist single
	- Frequentist mixture
	- Bayesian single
	- Bayesian mixture
		- loop with a list of models is bad
		- batch uses too much memory
		- batch with a specified mixture distribution so that you can split the matrices properly
		- minibatch (subsample)
- How do we store the results?
- Evaluation
	- Pseudolikelihoods
	- Number of true positives (how many inferred Jij terms are actual structural contacts/top plmc Jij terms compared to true)
	- Couplings map
